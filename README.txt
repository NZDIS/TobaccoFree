  Purpose

The purpose of the study is to establish
patterns and scale of smoking in passanger 
vehicles. Observers (people with mobile phones)
can download the application and provide help during
the data acquisition phase. 
For this, we have developped a mobile application 
and the website that stores the data.



  Android application for GlobaLink

The application currently runs on Android. 
You can download it from the market. It is 
called 'NZDIS Smoking'.
